      <h2>Why Me</h2>
      <p>As a recent college graduate, I know that what I'm lacking is career experience.<br></br> However, I
         have used my time at university to develop many of the required <br></br>skills for this job. 
         For example, after interning in four different organizations <br></br>and managing a full course 
         load while also working at the university's <br></br>admissions office,<br></br> <br></br>I learned how to multitask and 
         prioritize responsibilities. From what I understand, <br></br>in your fast-paced organization, the abilities
          to effectively prioritize tasks and <br></br>work with self-discipline are significant components of success.</p>
